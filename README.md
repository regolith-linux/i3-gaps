## i3-gaps

This repository is a snapshot of [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3) 4.19 release with the following changes:

* Provide a unique Debian package identity (`i3-gaps-wm`) over the upstream project, [i3-wm](https://github.com/i3/i3).
* Breaking the Xsession files into a distinct package, so that they can be selectively installed.

Please see the [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3) and [i3-wm](https://github.com/i3/i3) projects for all other details.
