## i3-gaps

This repository is a clone of [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3) with the following changes:

* Debian packaging metadata updated to provide a unique package identity over the upstream project, [i3](https://github.com/i3/i3).
* Breaking the Xsession files into a distinct package, so that they can be selectively installed.

Please see the [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3) project for all other details.
